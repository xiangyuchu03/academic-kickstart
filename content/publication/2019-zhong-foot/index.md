abstract: "Despite successful clinical applications, teleoperated robotic surgical systems face particular limitations in the functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) in terms of incompatible instrument dimensions and robot set-up. The endoscope remains manually handled by an assistant when the surgeon performs bimanual operations. This paper introduces the development of the Foot-controlled Robot-Enabled EnDOscope Manipulator (FREEDOM) designed for FESS. The system features clinical considerations that inform the design for providing reliable and safe endoscope positioning with minimal obstruction to the routine practice. The robot structure is modular and compact to ensure coaxial instrument manipulation through the nostril for manual procedures. To avoid rigid endoscope motions, a new compliant endoscope holder is proposed that passively limits the lens-tissue contact forces under collisions for patient-side protection. To facilitate hands-free endoscope manipulation that imposes minimal distractions to the surgeon, a foot-wearable interface is further designed to relieve the assistantâ€™s workload. The foot control method owns a short learning curve (mean 3.4 mins), and leads the task to be more ergonomic and surgeon-centered. Cadaver and clinical studies were both conducted to evaluate the surgical applicability of the FREEDOM to assist endoscope manipulation in FESS. The system was validated to be safe (IEC-60601-1) and easy for set up (mean 3.6 mins), from which the surgeon could perform various three-handed procedures alone in FESS without disrupting the routine practice."
