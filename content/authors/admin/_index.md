I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the [BTM](https://biomedirobotics.com/) group directed by [Prof. Kwok Wai Samuel Au](https://www4.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/peoples/au-kwok-wai-samuel/), Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong. Prior to my PhD study, I received B.E. and M.E. degrees at Harbin Institute of Technology, China. In the third year, I was visiting the group of [Prof. Hartmut Geyer](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hgeyer/) at Carnegie Mellon University.

My research interests include (teleoperated) locomotion and/or manipulation, underactuated control, bio-inspired robots, and medical robots. Keeping the interest in bio-inspired robots and their related underactuated control problems, I am also working on the topics of (teleoperated) locomotion and/or manipulation towards efficient and safe manipulation capabilities in healthcare and homecare.
