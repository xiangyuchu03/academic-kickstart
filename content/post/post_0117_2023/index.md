## Overview
Two conference papers that I mentored are accepted by ICRA 2023, and they are:

1. Towards Safe Landing of Falling Quadruped Robots Using a 3-DoF Morphable Inertial Tail by  Yunxi Tang, Jiajun An, Xiangyu Chu, Shengzhi Wang, Ching Yan Wong, and K. W. Samuel Au (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.15337.pdf)  
2. Towards Exact Interaction Force Control for Underactuated Quadrupedal Systems with Orthogonal Projection and Quadratic Programming by Shengzhi Wang, Xiangyu Chu, and K. W. Samuel Au (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.10238.pdf)

See you in London!
