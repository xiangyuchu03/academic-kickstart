## Overview
Robotic movements are becoming more agile. Although there is no unified definition of agility, agile movements have been interpreted in many ways – performing exotic motions, utilizing natural dynamics, moving across unstructured terrain, resolving survival issues, and more. Nonetheless, these agile behaviors still cannot reach those of animals, wherein biological systems outperform in many aspects – delicate body structure with passive mechanics/dynamics, complex neuromechanical motion planning and control systems, and advanced sensing capabilities like vision and haptics. Such discrepancy degenerates the robot's performance in real-world scenarios and prevents the robots from performing tasks that require quick response and overall stability. Thus, leveraging integrative biological studies of body physiology, neuroscience, and biomechanics, and robotic studies of mechanism design and manufacturing, planning and control, and lower- and higher-level kinematic and dynamic models appears to be the key to revealing the general mechanism and principle of agile movements. Specifically, this workshop wants to discuss:
1. What is the essence of agility in animals and robots? Do fast movements fully represent agile motion? If not, what other elements should be complementary?
2. After having a more comprehensive understanding of agility, how should we integrate it into applications like robot locomotion with current or other envisioning techniques?
